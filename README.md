Project Overview:
This project involves developing an IELTS preparation website for DSAIS Company. The website enables users to register, choose from IELTS study plans (Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking), make payments via Razorpay, and access their respective modules based on the selected plan.

The website is built using a Python Flask backend and a React.js frontend, with MySQL for database management. Payment handling is integrated with Razorpay to manage secure transactions.

Additionally, the website incorporates AI-based features to enhance the learning experience. These AI features will help in assessing users' performance, providing personalized feedback, and generating tasks based on their learning progress. The AI will be involved primarily in the Writing and Speaking modules, offering automated evaluation and guidance for improvement.
